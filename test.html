  <h1>The Future of Renewable Energy</h1>
  <p>
    Renewable energy is no longer just a niche interest—it has become a mainstream necessity. 
    <strong>Solar power is projected to provide over 30% of global electricity by 2030</strong>, according to recent studies. 
    Governments around the world are investing heavily in this sector, creating new opportunities for both businesses and consumers.

  <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
  <p>
    One of the most important benefits of renewable energy is its effect on the environment. 
    <strong>Switching to renewables could cut global carbon emissions by up to 40%</strong> by 2050. 
    Scientists emphasize that every fraction of reduction helps combat climate change.
  </p>

  <p>
    In conclusion, <strong>the renewable energy sector is set for unprecedented growth</strong>. 
    Investors, policymakers, and everyday citizens have roles to play in accelerating this transformation.
